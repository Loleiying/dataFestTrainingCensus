# dataFestTrainingCensus
Data Fest 2020 training data sets for me and my team.

As you may know, the US Census Bureau does a census of every person in the USA every 10 years (in fact, the next one is coming up soon on April 1st). They also do a yearly sample of a subset of the population, called the American Community Survey (ACS).
Some of the more interesting parts of the Census and ACS data are distributed in a big file called the "Planning Database": https://www.census.gov/topics/research/guidance/planning-databases.html This includes demographic information for small geographic areas (called Black Groups or Tracts) as well as an estimate of how many people didn't respond to the the Census Bureau (this is called the Low Response Score)
We're going to pretend that this is the dataset you have been given at DataFest. The Census Bureau wants to know:
What advice would you give local governments who wish to improve the response to the 2020 census? (edited) 

Let's aim to work on this dataset, and extract what insights we can, over the next 2 weeks or so.
The problem I am giving you is quite broad, but is similar to what you might be asked at Datafest. Your job is to come up with an insightful, creative response.

The Census dataset is a useful one to become familiar with, 

(1) because its widely used by data scientists in a variety of fields, and 
(2) because it's the sort of data that you can use as "External Data" in a real DataFest competition.

Getting started:

We'll meet after (or before?) Kaggle Club this Friday. Before then, you should:

Take a look at the Planning Database webpage linked above.

Look at the data dictionary linked on the webpage (i.e. the Documentation PDF) - I would suggest starting with Tracts, rather than Block Groups

Speaking of which, what are Tracts and Block Groups exactly?

What variables in the dataset do you notice that look interesting for the problem...

...and what kinds of analyses and visualizations could you do with them?

Are there any variables in the Planning Database that you don't understand?

Are there external data sources that you could pull in to make your analysis more impressive? 

As you're going through the dataset, keep in mind both the original question, and the DataFest competition categories: Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.
